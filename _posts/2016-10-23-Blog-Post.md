title: Top 100 Songs of 2000-Billboard
---

Who doesn't love to listen to his favorite song on the radio. I still remember the days when every time I turned the radio on, it seemed like the 'Gangam style' was playing, whether I liked it or not... But then it stopped all of a sudden and another song was playing not stop. On my blog I will explore the songs that made their way to billboard top 100 in the year 2000. To do that, I will be use the 'billboard.csv' database. That table has a row for each song appearing in the billboard top 100, during year 2000. The database contains track information, and the date it entered the top 100. It then shows the rank in each of the next 65 weeks.

So for start I explored the 'billboard.csv' database, the database contained more than 300 songs.
