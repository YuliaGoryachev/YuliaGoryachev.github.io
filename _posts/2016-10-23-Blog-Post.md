title: Top 100 Songs of 2000-Billboard
---

Who doesn't love to listen to his favorite song on the radio. I still remember the days when every time I turned the radio on, it seemed like the 'Gangam style' was playing, whether I liked it or not... But then it stopped all of a sudden and another song was playing not stop. On my blog I will explore the songs that made their way to billboard top 100 in the year 2000. To do that, I will be use the 'billboard.csv' database. That table has a row for each song appearing in the billboard top 100, during year 2000. The database contains track information, and the date it entered the top 100. It then shows the rank in each of the next 65 weeks.

So for start I explored the 'billboard.csv' database, the database contained more than 300 songs, from different Genres. Part of the weekly rank data was missing. I replaced all the missing NaN values by 100, since for top 100 chart is the lowest score a song can get. At this point I plotted few graphs to see what is the behavior of the ranks over the weeks. I saw the typical shape. Once the song enters the top 100 it has a fast increase to it's personal top, few weeks at the top and then steep decrease. As shown in the figure below.

Then, I wanted to see which genres were the most popular, which genres had the most top 100 songs. As can be seen in the pie chart below, Rock was the most popular.

Now, To find out which songs were in top 10, I culculated the number of weeks each song had in the top 10 rank. The list of the top 10 sengs is shown below, as expected 9 out of 10 songs were from the Rock genre.

This was a good year for Destiny's Child who scored two singles in top 10.
For comparison, this is the Top_10 chart from the official billboard site:
